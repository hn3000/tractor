# A Minimalist New Tab Page

Contains a minimalistic new tab page that aims to be non-distracting.

Uses one image from a collection of background images.

Possible improvements:

- resize images so they consume less memory, less traffic
- store today's list of TODO items (and done items?)
  - localStorage?
  - serviceWorker?
  - sync with server (e.g. github gist)
- make all images available for offline use (via service worker)

Non-goals:

- digital clock (or anything else but an analog clock)
- configurability
- use of frameworks
